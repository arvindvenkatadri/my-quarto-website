How???!!!\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe South Indian tradition of Kolam, and the [Angolan tradition of Lusona](https://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/archive-files3/paulus_gerdes_lunda_geometry_mirror_curves_desbook4you.pdf) art have quite a few things in common. Both are also strongly linked to finite grammars and networks.\n\n## {{< iconify icons8 idea >}} Inspiration\n\n<iframe src=\"https://openprocessing.org/sketch/296103/embed/\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\">\n\n</iframe>\n\nClick to generate a fresh Kolam!\n\n## Creating Kolams\n\nHow do we create these Kolam Patterns? Let us do this two ways: first\npretending we are a South-Indian Woman adorning her doorstep in the\nmorning. And then with two other methods, that lend themselves to\ncomputation / iteration. So, first by hand!\n\n## By Hand!\n\nSee if you can manually mimic some of the moves here! As an exercise,\ntry to **anchor your elbow and forearm to the table**, and draw the\npattern by rotating the paper! What are your observations?\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3a.gif)\n\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3b.gif)\n\n\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3c.gif)\n\n\n:::\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3d.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3e.gif)\n\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3f.gif)\n\n:::\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3g.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3h.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/3-3i.gif)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Method #1: Using **Canonical Pieces**\n\nWhat does **canonical piece** mean? These are pieces like the alphabet: pieces that can be repeatedly used to create a vast variety of patterns? Sounds familiar again?\n\nCheck the Polypad: <https://polypad.amplify.com/p#patterns>\n\nHere we use \"pieces of Kolam\" that are standard: by repeated usage of combinations of these pieces, ( I believe ) any kolam can be produced. Here is a video showing kolams with a few **canonical pieces**:\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/-l9za7UlzKM >}}\n\nWhich are the canonical pieces here?\n\nThis is also the idea embedded in this toy called [Kolam\nTiles](https://kolamtiles.com/). See this [YT Playlist on Kolam Tiles](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6LYOn0Nvs_spbp4kYo2llyTmwPbFdEUf&si=ThsBwebTaEYInKNr).\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam3_howto.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam4_howto.gif)\n\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam6_howto.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam7_howto.gif)\n\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam9_howto.gif)\n\n![](../../../../../materials/gifs/kolam10_howto.gif)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Method #2: Using Mirrors and Light\n\nThis follows the development of [Paul\nGerdes](https://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/paulus/index.html). \n\nFirst let us get a printable grid to make our Kolams manually, since\nmaking grids can become tedious when you are making a lot of Kolams. We\ncan use the grid to place \"pulli-s\" on the grid to make our Kolam. Head\noff to: <https://editor.p5js.org/arvindv/sketches/UuHApkvqd> and open it\nin your p5.js web-editor. Print out a few samples of the `.svg` grid\nfile that is generated.\n\nNow consider that each of your Kolam \"lines\" or \"trajectories\" is [made\nof light](https://www.imaginary.org/program/frozenlight). And place some\nsingle horizontal or vertical mirrors, at some locations *midway between\nadjacent pulli-s*. See the figure below:\n\n![Kolam with Mirrors](../../../../../materials/gifs/Kolam-With-Mirrors.png){#fig-kolam-with-mirrors}\n\nThe black lines here are to be imagined as *\"made of light\"*. Whenever\nthey hit a mirror, a *\"curved reflection\"* occurs. Note how the\narrangement of mirrors is symmetric here. Can we take *computational\nliberties* here and make asymmetric mirror arrangements? Can the grid\nalso be non-square? Try?\n\nFor more inspiration, see\n[here](https://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/paulus/pg1.htm). This is a multipage article with many different grid+mirror arrangements! There is also an intriguing technique shown therein of **colouring the squares in the grid** alternatively white and black, to generate very symmetric shaded patterns!\n\n## Kolams with Code\n\nWork in (slow....) Progress!!!\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style=\"background: whitesmoke;\"}\n\n\n\n### Using p5.js\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"780px\" height=\"600px\" \n\n</iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n### Using R\n\n:::\n\n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\nKolams and Sona are powerful metaphors for [graphs and networks](../../../../Analytics/Descriptive/Modules/100-Networks/index.qmd). These ideas show up in a variety of situations, such as tranportation networks, supply-chain, friendship networks, tracing literary and artistic influence, and so on. \n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
