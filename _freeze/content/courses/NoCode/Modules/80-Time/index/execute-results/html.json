Why? Should we watch\n[Grey's Anatomy](https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/greys-anatomy/14823) ?\n\nAnd why more births in September? That should be a no-brainer!! ðŸ˜†\n:::\n\n\n## {{< iconify mdi food-processor-outline >}} How do these Chart(s) Work?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals forms a **time\nseries**. Analysis of Time Series is commercially important because of\nindustrial need and relevance, especially with respect to Forecasting\n(Weather data, sports scores, population growth figures, stock prices,\ndemand, sales, supply...).\n\nThe X-axis is mapped to a *temporal variable* (i.e. representing time). The Y-axis is mapped to one or more Quant variables. We can easily get a sense of rhythm, season, cyclical variations, peaks, troughs....and whether something is getting seriously out of hand over time. [Sadly](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/)\n\nWe can also take averages of the Y-axis Quant variable, over periods of X-axis variable; e.g. weekly or monthly averages. This is called *smoothing* of the data. \n\n## {{< iconify ion bar-chart >}} Plotting a Time Series Line Chart\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style=\"background: whitesmoke;\"}\n### Using Orange\n\nThe Time Series Line Chart widget in Orange is described here. <https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/time-series/line_chart/>\n\nLet us take some Births related data and plot it in Orange. \n\n{{< downloadthis data/US_births_2000_2014_SSA.csv dname=\"births\" label=\"Download the US Births data\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\nAnd download the Line Chart workflow file for this data:\n\n{{< downloadthis Orange/time-series.ows dname=\"time-series\" label=\"Download the Time Series Line Chart Workflow\" icon=\"database-fill-down\" type=\"info\" >}}\n\nNote how we have two widgets for the Line Charts. More shortly. \n\n### Using RAWgraphs\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/38nbSYy4VWw >}}\n\n\n\n### Using DataWrapper\n\nWe can use a built-in dataset to create a line chart for browser usage:\n![](images/R17XS-the-rise-of-google-chrome.png)\n\nNote that DataWrapper again requires/uses data in wide format to create its Line Charts!!\n\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify cil child >}} Dataset: Born in the USA\n\n> Tourist: Any famous people born around here?\\\n> Guide: No sir, best we can do is babies.\n\n### {{< iconify file-icons influxdata >}} Examine the Data\n\n![Born in the USA](../../../../materials/images/Orange/births-data-table.png){#fig-births-data-table}\n\n\n![Births Summary Table](../../../../materials/images/Orange/births-summary-table.png){#fig-births-summary-table}\n\n### {{< iconify streamline dictionary-language-book-solid >}} Data Dictionary\n\n::: callout-note\n### Quantitative Data\n\n-   `year`, `month`, `date_of_month`: (int) Columns giving time information\n-   `day-of_week`: (int) Additional Time information\n-   `births`: (int) Total live births across the USA that day\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n### Qualitative Data\nNone. Though we might covert `day_of_week` and `month` into Qual variables later. \n:::\n\nEvenly spread `year`, `month`, `date_of_month` and `day_of_week` variables...the bumps are curious though, no? `day_of_week` is of course neat. `births` are numerical data and have a good spread with a [bimodal distribution](../22-Histograms/index.qmd#wait-but-why) distribution. Some numbers in the mid-range hardly occur at all...\nSo a premonition of some two-valued phenomenon here already. \n\n\n### {{< iconify material-symbols query-stats >}} Research Questions\n\n::: callout-note\nQ1. What does the `births` data look like over the years?\n\n![Birts over the Years](../../../../materials/images/Orange/births-over-the-years.png){#fig-births-over-years}\nHmmm...very busy graph. The overall trend is a slight bump in births around 2007 and then a slow reduction in births. Large variations otherwise, which we need to see in finer detail on a magnified scale, *a folded scale*,  or by averaging. \n\n~~Converting `month` or `day_of_week` to categorical in the File Menu does not provide us with a way of separating the time series by month or weekday...sad.~~. We will be able to average over month, day_of_week to see what happens. \n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nQ2. What do births look like averaged over `month`?\n\n![](../../../../materials/images/Orange/time-series-with-averaging.png)\n\nThis is good! We have converted the dataset to a timeseries, of course, and then added a `moving transform` widget, that allows us to take averages of `births` over weeks, months, or years. Play with this setting in the `moving transform` widget. \n\nWe see that averaging i.e. $aggregating$ by *Month of year* clearly shows September as the month for the most number of births.\n\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nQ2. What do births look like averaged over `day_of_week`?\n\nHere too with the `moving transform` widget, choosing `Day of Week` as the aggregating parameter, we see a dip in births over weekends.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n### Folded Scale?\nLook at the figure below.\n\n![Aggregate over Days of Week](../../../../materials/images/Orange/Aggregate-births-week-of-year.png){#fig-aggregate-over-day-of-week}\n\nIt should be apparent that the line chart shows averages based on \"Week of Year\". What does that mean?\n\nImagine a carpenter's folding footrule:\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Metre_pliant_500px.png)\n\nImagine the entire time series stretched out and then folded over itself at intervals of a **week**. There will of course be overlapping data that represent data points for [the same week year after year.]{style=\"background: yellow;\"} THAT is what goes into the averaging!\n\nSo we see that the weeks in September show the highest average birth numbers, which seems right!\n\n:::\n\n## {{< iconify teenyicons candle-chart-outline >}} Other Plots\n\nImagine that we follow this overlap routine and get the data by same-week-of-year, as before. We need not necessarily average that data; we can simply plot each (repeated) week's worth of data as a box plot. This results in an array of boxplots, one per week, and is called a *candlestick plot*. \nClearly we can do this for months, weeks, and even days of the week. Here is what it looks like; it does not seem possible to create these with any of the tools we are currently using. \n\n![](images/candlestick.png){#fig-candlestick}\n[As before](../28-BoxPlotsViolins/index.qmd), the medians are the black lines across each boxplot, which is one for each *month*. Note that since the medians are towards the upper end of the boxplots, we can guess that the per-month distribution must be skewed to the left (lower than median values are less frequent).\n\nIf the Quantities that vary over time are not *continuous* but *discrete* values such as `high`, `medium`, and `low`,, a time-series heatmap is also a possibility. \n\n![](images/heatmap.png){#fig-time-series-heatmap}\nVery arbitrarily slicing the birth numbers into three bins titled `high`, `fine`, and `low`, we can plot a heatmap like this. Orange does have a heatmap widget, however it seems suited to Machine Learning methods such as Clustering. We need to investigate its possibilities for time series. \n\n## {{< iconify bi person-up >}} Your Turn\n\n1.

Plot these as time series, and try getting historical data, or data on festivals or important occasions in specific cities. \n\n## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?\n\n- We encounter many things that vary over time: weather, wealth, No. of users or downloads of an app, hits to a webpage, customers at a supermarket, or population of animals or plants in a region.\n- These are best represented by Line Charts\n- As humans, we are also deeply interested in patterns of recurrence over time, and in forecasting for the future, using tech, and using say [Oracles](https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php/A_Point_of_Contact).\n- Both these purposes are amply served by Line Charts.\n\n\n\n## {{< iconify ooui references-ltr >}} References\n\n1.
