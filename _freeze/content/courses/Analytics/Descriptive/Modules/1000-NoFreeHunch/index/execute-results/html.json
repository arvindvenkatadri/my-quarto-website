Open your wallet and show me how much. Guys and Gals. \nWill this work in these UPI days? And well-dressed Gals don't have pockets in their clothing, uncle...\nSo then ask **\"How much did you spend today?\"** Again, Guys and Gals. \n\nAnd then a two independent sample test for means. And Permutation and all that stuff.\n\n## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #2: I will eat my tip, thank you. \n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} The average tip people give is higher for people who are non-vegetarians. Regardless of whether you are [going Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch) or not.\n:::\n\nAre vegetarians more kanjoos? Or it is the meat-eaters?\n\nSo Swiggy/Zomato/Dining Out bills. For both sets of people. And then the t-t-t-t-t-test...\n\n## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #3: Art, Design, and Vocation are all diff-different. \n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Grades are very different between B.Voc, B.Cra, and B.Des folks. \n:::\n\nSo? Grades of course, for a good sample from all *three* groups of people..and then?\nANOVA of course. \n\n## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #4: Chhota Bheem vs Doraemon vs Dragon Tales\n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Doraeomon >> Dragon Tales >> Chhota Bheem!\n:::\nThe [**Anywhere Door**](https://doraemon.fandom.com/wiki/Anywhere_Door) makes Doraemon the greatest children's show on earth. But Dragon Tales also has that [**Dragon Stone thingy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crystals/comments/qxuc9r/i_wish_i_wish_with_all_my_heart_to_fly_with/?rdt=57455)...\"I wish, I wish..\" \n\nAnd that flute musical in Chhota Bheem...Uff!\n\n<center>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<audio controls> <source src='best-krishna-flute-2448.mp3' type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio tag;  for browser support, please see:  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp </audio>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n</center>\n\nSo? Get Opinion scores from people. Scale of 10. And then? Oh, ANOVA, peasants!\n\n\n## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #5: I am an INTJ\n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Srishti kids are predominantly introverted\n:::\n\nWhat are we looking at, data-wise? A *proportion*, which if more than 50% would justify our hunch. So we do an MBTI on some unsuspecting **sample** of people, and try to generalize that result to the **population**.\n\n\n## {{< iconify mdi insect size = 1.5em >}} {{< iconify game-icons pointy-hat >}} Free Hunch #6: Let's Go to ChefsTouch(?)\n\n::: callout-important\n## {{< iconify academicons hypothesis-square >}} Most people think the food in the mess/cafeteria is ordinary.\n:::\nAgain, a survey of a sample. Opinions, yes or no. A Proportion for the sample, and an extension to the population. A *proportion test*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n1.
