After having a difficult childhood, he roamed across the\n> Russian empire, frequently changing jobs for about fifteen years\n> before he became a successful writer. The experiences he had during\n> those fifteen years deeply influenced his writing. Initially, he wrote\n> stories mainly based on the lives of tramps and social outcasts, and\n> he became known for his naturalistic style of writing. One of his\n> greatest works is ‘The Mother,’ which Lenin praised as “a very timely\n> book.”\n\n> Gorky was deeply associated with fellow Russian writers, Anton Chekhov\n> and Leo Tolstoy and later wrote memoirs on them. Gorky was not only a\n> great writer but also an influential figure in the political thinking.\n> He was active with the emerging Marxist social-democrat movement.\n> Initially a Bolshevik supporter, he became a critic when Vladimir\n> Lenin seized power. However, later Gorky served as a Soviet advocate\n> and headed the Union of Soviet Writers. His life was marked with a\n> number of politically forced and sometimes self-imposed exiles.\n\n> He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n## Story\n\nWe will read Gorky's story <u>[The\nClown.](Maxim%20Gorky%20-%20The%20Clown.docx)</u>\n\n## Themes\n\n-   Being Pretentious and Being Genuine\n-   Humour as way to examine Life[^1]\n-   What does a Court Jester/Stand-Up Comedian do for a living[^2]?\n-   A Joker in a pack of cards?\n-   Street Events, The Bystander Effect, and Jane Jacobs' idea \"*Eyes on the Street*\"\n-   Signalling and How to Speak without Talking\n-   Risk Taking for the Benefit of Society\n-   Hating Oneself for Cowardice?\n-   Envy / Jealousy and Anger\n\n## Additional Material\n\n### Notes and References\n\n1.
