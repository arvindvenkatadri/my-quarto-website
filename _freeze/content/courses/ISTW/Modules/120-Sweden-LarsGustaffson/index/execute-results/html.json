He served as a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, where he taught Philosophy and Creative Writing, until May 2006, when he retired.\n>\n> Gustafsson is one of the most prolific Swedish writers since August Strindberg. Since the late 1950s he has produced a voluminous flow of poetry, novels, short stories, critical essays, and editorials. He is also an example of a Swedish writer who has gained international recognition with literary awards such as the Prix International Charles Veillon des Essais in 1983, the Heinrich Steffens Preis in 1986, Una Vita per la Litteratura in 1989, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for poetry in 1994, and several others.\n\n### Story\n\nWe will read <u>[Greatness Strikes Where It Pleases.](LArs%20Gustafsson%20-%20Greatness%20Strikes%20Where%20it%20Pleases.docx)</u>\n\n> \"Greatness Strikes Where It Pleases\" by Swedish writer Lars Gustafsson, was first published in Sweden in 1981.

It was internationally successful, reaching the top 20 in several countries including a #6 peak in the US and a #7 peak in the UK – their best showing in both countries. In Canada, “The Logical Song” not only topped the Canada Singles Chart, but was the #1 song of the entire year.\n“The Logical Song,” not unlike others in that period (eg – Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall”) is a scathing criticism of British school and education at the time.\nWhen Paul McCartney was asked his favorite song of 1979, he chose “The Logical Song”. The song also won (Roger) Hodgson an Ivor Novello award from The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters in 1980.\n\n{{< youtube vD7HJcpJD9U >}}\n\n## Writing Prompts\n\n1.
