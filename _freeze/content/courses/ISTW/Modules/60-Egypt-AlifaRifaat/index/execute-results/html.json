Rifaat\n> (1930–1996) did not go to university, spoke only Arabic, and seldom\n> traveled abroad. This virtual immunity from Western influence lends a\n> special authenticity to her direct yet sincere accounts of death,\n> sexual fulfillment, the lives of women in purdah, and the frustrations\n> of everyday life in a male-dominated Islamic environment.\\\n>\n> Translated from the Arabic by [Denys Johnson-Davies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/18/denys-johnson-davies-obituary)\n> the collection admits the reader into a hidden private world,\n> regulated by the call of the mosque, but often full of profound\n> anguish and personal isolation. Badriyya’s despairing anger at her\n> deceitful husband, for example, or the haunting melancholy of “At the\n> Time of the Jasmine,” are treated with a sensitivity to the discipline\n> and order of Islam.\n\n## Story\n\nWe will read Rifaat's story *Bahiyya's Eyes* from the Collection\n<u>[**Distant View of a Minaret and Other\nStories**.](Distant%20View%20of%20a%20Minaret%20and%20Other%20Storie%20-%20Rifaat,%20Alifa.pdf)</u>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DistantView.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=149}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Themes\n\n-   Age and Aging\n-   Poverty, Disease, and Healthcare\n-   Woman's Place in Society\n-   \"Eyes are the Gateway to the Soul\" - Herman Melville\n-   Religion, Tradition, and Conservative Belief: Is Belief always\n    \"Blind\"?\n-   Through a Child's Eyes: A Child's Discoveries about the World\n-   Children and Family\n\n## Additional Material\n\n### Notes and References\n\n1.  بَهِيّ**ة** Bahiyyah is an Arabic name for girls that means\n    “brilliant”, “beautiful”, “radiant”.\n\n2.
