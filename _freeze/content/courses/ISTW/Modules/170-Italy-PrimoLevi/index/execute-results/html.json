There he remained until the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945. He arrived back home in Turin in October, unrecognisable to the concierge who had seen him only a couple of years earlier.\n\n\n\n### Story\n\n**Hydrogen** from Primo Levi's collection *The Periodic Table* <u><https://archive.org/download/ThePeriodicTable-PrimoLevi/periodic-primo.pdf></u>\n\n\n### Themes  \n- Epiphany  \n- Curiosity, the Desire to Know, and Perseverance  \n- Rule Breaking  \n- \"Other Worldliness\"  \n- Metaphors: Describing an idea using vocabulary from another domain\n- TRIZ, aka <u>[Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskhikh Zadatch](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/slides/playandinvent/triz-basics-new/#1)</u>\n\n\n## Additional Material  \n\n### Notes and References  \n\n1. The last story in **The Periodic Table**, titled <u>[**Carbon**](https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/periodic-primo.pdf)</u> is also a fantastic metaphoric journey of a single Carbon atom. Read it!! It has been described as the most accessible piece of science writing!\n\n1. More Holocaust Reading:\n    * Tadeuscz Borowski's **\"Postal Indiscretions\"** is a series of letters written from a concentration camp.  \n    * His short story, **This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen**  is also a harrowing read. <u>[**Weblink to PDF**](https://www.pelister.org/courses/topics/borowski/this-way-for-gas.pdf)</u>  \n    * The World of Tadeuscz Borowski's Auschwitz <u><https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2021/09/12/the-world-of-tadeusz-borowskis-auschwitz/></u>\n\n\n1. <u><https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/22/primo-levi-auschwitz-if-this-is-a-man-memoir-70-years></u>\n\n1. A Student Reflection on Primo Levi's **Hydrogen**: <u><https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-325-small-wonders-staying-alive-spring-2007/assignments/periodic2.pdf></u>\n\n    \n1. Extract from <u>[**“The key to the highest truths”: Primo Levi and the beauty of chemistry**](https://www.varsity.co.uk/science/19837)</u>\n\n  > Nonetheless, reading Levi’s writing over lockdown, I was reminded that he also witnessed chemistry’s most detestable side at Auschwitz, as part of the Chemical Kommando transporting magnesium chloride, and at the IG-Farben laboratory. Despite this, Levi never lost sight of the beauty of chemistry: for me, found in the sublimation of brilliant emerald-green crystals of nickelocene; in the jagged, imperfect trace of an action potential on the electromyograph; in the faint rainbow of lines emitted by potassium under a sodium discharge lamp. If Levi were to observe us in these practical classes, complete with our rash deductions, amateurish mistakes and shattered glassware, I like to think he would be pleased.\n\n\n\n \n### Song for the Story !!\n\nSong: Flying Sorcery\nArtiste: Al Stewart\n\nAlastair(\"Al\") Ian Stewart (born 5 September 1945) is a Scottish singer-songwriter and folk-rock musician who rose to prominence as part of the British folk revival in the 1960s and 1970s. He developed a unique style of combining folk-rock songs with delicately woven tales of characters and events from history.\n\n{{< youtube klsTowdcEsk >}}\n\n<div id='rg_embed_link_791930' class='rg_embed_link' data-song-id='791930'>Read <a href='https://genius.com/Al-stewart-flying-sorcery-lyrics'>“Flying Sorcery” by Al Stewart</a> on Genius</div> <script crossorigin src='//genius.com/songs/791930/embed.js'></script>\n\n## Writing Prompts\n1.
