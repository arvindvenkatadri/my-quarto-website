Upon its release, and especially in subsequent years, \"Allentown\" emerged as an anthem of blue-collar America, representing both the aspirations and frustrations of America's working class in the late 20th century.\n\n{{< youtube BHnJp0oyOxs >}} <br> Well we're living here in Allentown\\\nAnd they're closing all the factories down\\\nOut in Bethlehem they're killing time\\\nFilling out forms\\\nStanding in line\\\nWell our fathers fought the Second World War\\\nSpent their weekends on the Jersey Shore\\\nMet our mothers in the USO[^1]\\\nAsked them to dance\\\nDanced with them slow\\\nAnd we're living here in Allentown\\\n\n[^1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Service_Organizations>\n\nBut the restlessness was handed down\\\nAnd it's getting very hard to stay\\\n\nWell we're waiting here in Allentown\\\nFor the Pennsylvania we never found\\\nFor the promises our teachers gave\\\nIf we worked hard\\\nIf we behaved\\\n\nSo the graduations hang on the wall\\\nBut they never really helped us at all\\\nNo they never taught us what was real\\\nIron and coal\\\nAnd chromium steel\\\nAnd we're waiting here in Allentown\\\n\nBut they've taken all the coal from the ground\\\nAnd the union people crawled away\\\n\nEvery child has a pretty good shot\\\nTo get at least as far as their old man got\\\nBut something happened on the way to that place\\\nThey threw an American flag in our face\\\n\nWell I'm living here in Allentown\\\nAnd it's hard to keep a good man down\\\nBut I won't be giving up today\\\n\nAnd we're living here in Allentown\\\n\n## Writing Prompts\n\n1.
