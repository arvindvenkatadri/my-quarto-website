After the Russian Navy destroyed\na Turkish squadron in the Black Sea, Great Britain and France joined\nwith Turkey. In September of the following year, the British landed on\nthe Crimean Peninsula and set out, with the French and Turks, to take\nthe Russian naval base at Sevastopol.\n\nWhat followed was a tragicomedy of errors -- failure of supply, failed\ncommunications, international rivalries. Conditions in the armies were\nterrible, and disease ate through their ranks. They finally did take\nSevastopol a year later, after a ghastly assault. It was ugly business\nall around. Well over half a million soldiers lost their lives during\nthe Crimean War.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Florence Nightingale's Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Month Year Disease.rate Wounds.rate Other.rate\n1    Apr 1854          1.4         0.0        7.0\n2    May 1854          6.2         0.0        4.6\n3    Jun 1854          4.7         0.0        2.5\n4    Jul 1854        150.0         0.0        9.6\n5    Aug 1854        328.5         0.4       11.9\n6    Sep 1854        312.2        32.1       27.7\n7    Oct 1854        197.0        51.7       50.1\n8    Nov 1854        340.6       115.8       42.8\n9    Dec 1854        631.5        41.7       48.0\n10   Jan 1855       1022.8        30.7      120.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## How Does Data look Like, then?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](/content/materials/images/Ratio-Interval-Ordinal-Nominal.PNG)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n#### Types of Variables - Using Interrogative Pronouns\n\n-   Nominal: What?
