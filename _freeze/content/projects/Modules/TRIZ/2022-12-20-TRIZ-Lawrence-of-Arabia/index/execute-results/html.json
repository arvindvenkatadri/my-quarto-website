I give an\nanalysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including\nthe formulation of the **Contradiction**, **Identification of Causes**,\nthe statement of the **Ideal Final Result**, and finally using the\n**TRIZ Contradiction Matrix** to find **Inventive Principles** that\ninform Lawrence's solution. I also dwell in passing upon aspects of how\nthis story can be interpreted as a manifestation of Mihaly\nCsikszentmihalyi's **Creativity Systems Model**.\n\nThis piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative Thinking and\nProblem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*, over the past 8\nyears or more at the *Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and\nTechnology, Bangalore, India*. (<https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in>).\n\n## Lawrence of Arabia: a Summary\n\nThe movie is the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who\nsuccessfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes\nduring World War I in order to fight the Turks. The stellar cast\nincludes Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Ali, Alec Guinness as\nPrince Feisal, Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Claude Raines as Dryden,\nand Anthony Quayle as Col. Brighton. The director was David Lean. The\nediting of the film by Anne Coates is also much admired. (\n<https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/tag/lawrence-of-arabia/> )\n\nLawrence is a complex, talented, and yet simple man, who is extremely\nwell read (Greek philosophy and the Koran, for example) and is also an\nexpert in Arab affairs and has considerable skill at map-making. Due to\nhis being interpreted as insolent and insubordinate , he is given a\nlowly job at the HQ in Cairo. Dryden manages to convince the General\nthat Lawrence should be allowed to go into Arabia and to find out what\nkind of long-term plans Prince Feisal is making for Arabia.\n\nHere is the map of the events that are unfolding in the movie at this\ntime.[^1]\n\n<center>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1S7HsEtlbpmbIdrI3n8v-SA9pxaU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"950\" height=\"500\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nLawrence encounters Ali in dramatic fashion at the Masturah Well, on the\nway to meet Feisal, and his Arab guide is shot by Ali, a direct\nexperience for Lawrence of inter-tribe rivalry in Arabia. (Ali is a\nHarith, and Tafas the guide was a Hashemi). Lawrence peremptorily\nrejects an offer of help from Ali, and finds his way alone to Wadi\nSafra, where Feisal is camped. He is met by Col. Brighton as he nears\nthe camp. Both enter camp just in time to witness another bombing raid\nby Turkish airplanes.\n\nLater in the meeting with Feisal, Brighton tries to convince Feisal to\nretreat to Yenbo (Yanbu) and be out of range for the Turks, and where\nthe British Army would supply them, train them to fight against the\nTurks. Feisal reluctantly accepts this plan, though he would rather the\nBritish navy take the port city of Aqaba and supply his army from there.\nBrighton simply scoffs at that idea, because *the Turkish have 12 inch\nguns at Aqaba* and *the British have other things to do*.\n\nLawrence has already intrigued Feisal by completing a verse from the\nKoran as it was being read by Selim, the cleric. At the end of the\nmeeting, Feisal confronts Lawrence alone, as to *his* intentions in\nArabia and finds out, to his astonishment, that Lawrence has his own\ninterpretation of what his tasks and loyalties were, and these did not\nnecessarily coincide with those of Brighton. In fact, Lawrence is *not*\nin favour of the Arab Army's retreat to Yenbo, as *it would become one\nsmall part of the British Army*. As a parting remark, Feisal says to\nLawrence that the Arabs *need what no man can provide, a miracle*.\n\nHere is the video of that terrific tent meeting scene.\n\n<center>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K34S8q76gDo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n</center>\n\n## Lawrence's Problem\n\nLawrence does not sleep that night. Provoked by Feisal's parting remark,\nhe sits up all night on a sand dune close to the camp, thinking about\nhow Aqaba could be taken, since he wants the Arabs to continue fighting\nfrom where they were, and even advance if possible with British help.\nHis detailed understanding of the Arabian geography, his knowledge of\nthe Aqaba port and its fortifications, all come to the fore here. Aqaba\nis a port at the head end of a narrow gulf to the east of the Sinai\nPeninsula.\n\nIn the early morning, seemingly in a [eureka\nmoment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect), he decides that\nattacking Aqaba from the landward side would be a good solution, since\nthe guns there could not be turned around.\n\nHere is Lawrence trying to convince Ali about this plan:\n\n<center>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZQSpMiaaxk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n</center>\n\nLawrence does not inform Brighton of his plans, nor even Feisal. It is\nAli who informs Feisal of this enterprise. Clearly, Lawrence does not\nconsider Brighton as a member of his *Field* (as defined by\nCsikszentmihalyi in his [Creativity Systems\nModel](https://medium.com/call4/domain-8a22b6b486f4)), but Feisal is a\nField Member to Ali.\n\nApropos, the act of sitting up all night can be seen as the Incubation\nand Elaboration stages of the [5 Stages of\nCreativity](https://pearce.caah.clemson.edu/the-5-step-creative-process/)\nfrom Csikszentmihalyi (Preparation, Incubation, Insight, Elaboration,\nExecution).\n\n## A TRIZ Analysis of the Plan to Take Aqaba\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, using the method described in *Open Source TRIZ*,\n(<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k>), we identify *knobs* or\n*parameters* within the situation and see how turning these could lead\nto identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a **Contradiction**.\n\nHere below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* for this purpose:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTurning the *knobs/parameters* in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if\nthe British allies attack Aqaba, they may win, BUT they may lose a few\nwarships. If the Arabs want to attack, they are too small in number and\nhave no warships, and hence their chances of success are very slim.\nHerein lies the Contradiction, which we can now specify as an\n[**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp) in\n*plain English*:\n\n> <center>**AC**: The Arabs need the British to supply them via Aqaba\n> port. Aqaba has huge guns and they will sink the British ships in that\n> narrow gulf if they try a naval attack. So the Arabs need to take\n> Aqaba without losing British ships.</center>\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa\nDiagram above, we are now ready to define the *Ideal Final Result*:\n\n> <center>**IFR**: The Arabs need to attack and take Aqaba port, and the\n> big guns there should have no effect.</center>\n\nNote how the tone of this IFR is like a \"eat my cake and have it too\".\nVery typical for IFRs, this impossible-sounding tone!\n\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*.\nWe will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in the [*TRIZ Contradiction\nMatrix* **(PDF)**](../../materials/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see\nwhich Parameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is\nwhat we can attempt, stating the Contradiction both ways[^2]:\n\n> **- TC 1**: Increase `Duration of Action of a Moving Object` (12) and\n> not worsen `Stability of Objects Composition` (21)\\\n> **- TC 2**: Increase `Stability of Objects Composition` (21) and not\n> worsen `Duration of Action of a Moving Object` (12)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that the guns at Aqaba\nshould not affect the Arab attack at all. The Parameters chosen from the\nTRIZ Matrix can be thought of as **metaphors** for the knobs that lie\nwithin our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making\nmetaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter `Power(18)` or\n`Illumination Intensity(23)` to \"metaphorize\" the effectiveness of the\nattack, if our imaginations run in that direction. There is here a\nconsiderable flexibility and possibility for imaginative interpretations\nof the AC, but using the **language of TRIZ**.\n\nWe could even stretch to making a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^3]\nhappen:\n\n> <center>**PC**: The Ships must be near the guns but not be near enough\n> to be shot at. (They must be near and not near at the same\n> time)</center>\n\n## Solving the Technical Contradiction\n\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive\nat the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution\nfor TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matrix.png){width=125% height=125%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1)\n\n1.  IP 13 (The Other Way Around)\\\n2.  IP 35 (Parameter Change)\\\n3.  IP 24 (Intermediary)\\\n4.  IP 40 (Composite Materials)\n\nand (TC2)\n\n5.  IP 10 (Preliminary Action)\\\n6.  IP 5 (Merging)\n7.  ~~IP 35 (Parameter Change)~~\\\n8.  ~~IP 13 (The Other Way Around)~~\n\nHow are we to apply these Inventive Principles? Here again is an\nimaginative exercise as we map these **Generalized Solutions** back into\nthe Problem at hand:\n\n-   **IP 13: The Other Way Around**. Change the Direction? Of what? Two\n    aspects have \"direction\" as attributes: the attack, and the guns,\n    which Lawrence can't control. So how does he use this? Not attack by\n    sea? Wait...**ATTACK BY LAND**!! Change the **DIRECTION** of Attack!\n    So attack from the other side, the land side!! (We could\n    retrospectively add this parameter to the Ishikawa Diagram too).\n    Will this work? Yes, the guns can't turn around!!\n\n-   **IP 35: Parameter Change**. But \"ships\" on land?? Note, *the desert\n    is an ocean into which no oar is dipped*. Sand and Water are both\n    **Resources** in the problem, as we have duly noted in the Ishikawa\n    Diagram. So a different kind of ocean and therefore a different kind\n    of ship? At a stretch, we can say the warships of the British Navy\n    are being substituted with the use of ....Camels!! And,\n    metaphorically speaking, it is *still* an attack using ships....*The\n    Ships of the Desert*!! So water becomes sand, and the warships\n    become camels using Parameter Change !\n\n-   **IP 10: Prior Action**. How? Lawrence and Ali are far from Aqaba\n    and cannot do anything \"in advance\". What could this be?\n\n-   **IP 5: Merging**. However, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence and Ali\n    must **recruit the Howeitat tribe \"in advance\" of their attack** !!\n    As Lawrence tells Ali, *If 50 men came out of the Nefud Desert, they\n    might be 50 men other men would join*. This is in accordance with\n    what IP 10 is suggesting, to get other tribes to join in, *in\n    advance* of the attack.\n\n-   **IP 40: Composite Materials**. What object within the situation can\n    we reconstitute with smaller pieces of different types? The British\n    Army...so an army made up of pieces? Yes! The Tribes need to unite\n    into one *composite* army.\\\n    And, instead of large warships, the Arabs switch to a *composite*\n    force with camels...\n\nSo IP 13 works nicely now, along with IP 35 and IP 40, to give us a\n*camel-borne attack from the landward side*. IP 10 also teams up with IP\n40 and IP 5 to give the idea of *tribe unification*.\n\nAnd so Lawrence and Ali, with the help of Auda Abu Tayi, attack Aqaba\nport from the landward side by crossing the Nefud desert on camels, and\ntake it! And we have justified their decision using TRIZ !!\n\nHere is the final solution in action !!\n\n<center>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lChJz2DSpsE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n</center>\n\n<br> I hope that was as much fun to read as it was for me to write it up\n!!\n\n## Points to Ponder\n\n-   Do we each of us need a Dryden to vouch for us and help us get\n    access to the Field?\n-   Does TRIZ work in both mundane and industrial contexts? (Yes of\n    course!)\n-   Can we just take the 40 Inventive Principles directly and throw them\n    at every Problem, without necessarily going through the process of\n    creating Contradictions and IFR? Hipple's book has a remark in this\n    direction.\n\n## References\n\n1.  Lawrence of Arabia at the Internet Movie Data Base\n    <https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/>\n2.
