The first edition\nanalysing the famous movie Lawrence of Arabia is\n[**here**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/).\n\nThe recent series of ads by Spotify have been very well received, by the\nad industry as well. There have been several of these ads, each with a\nsolid little story and a great punch line. There is one popular one that\nI have selected here, featuring a Mother shopping for veggies, while her\nson *watches* (and \"listens\") to her bargaining with the shopkeeper.\nHere I take just that highly effective ad and interpret it from a *TRIZ*\nviewpoint.\n\nThis piece stems from my teaching a course on Creative Thinking and\nProblem Solving based on TRIZ, titled *Play and Invent*, over the past 8\nyears or more at the *Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and\nTechnology, Bangalore, India*. (<https://srishtimanipalinstitute.in>).\n\n## The Famous Spotify Ad\n\nLet us watch the Spotify ad first, before analyzing it!\n\n<iframe width=\"760\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1WP5J-I9f8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n## The Young Man's Problem\n\nIn order to make a *story* out of this, I want make a\n[**Protagonist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist) out the\nyoung man in the ad. It is he who has the problem and he who is going to\napply TRIZ to solve it. I discuss the source of his Problem and give an\nanalysis of the Problem from a (classical) TRIZ perspective, including\nthe formulation of the *Contradiction*, *Identification of Causes*, the\nstatement of the *Ideal Final Result*, and finally using the *TRIZ\nContradiction Matrix* to find *Inventive Principles*, that lead to the\nsolution, which of course, is meant to unerringly include Spotify !\n\nFirst a philosophical digression:---\n\nSeveral authors have taken a Game View of life. James P Carse's famous\nbook titled *Finite and Infinite Games* [**speaks\nof**](https://fs.blog/finite-and-infinite-games/) Play, Types of Games,\nRules, Winning and our own aims in the Game itself. A similar\narticulation is, in my opinion, that of [Mihaly\nCsikszentlmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi)\nin his concept of Flow, shown here below:\n\n![From\nSketchplanations](sketchplanations-match-challenge-with-skills-for-flow-at-work.jpg)\n\nWhen the Game presents very little Challenge, we are *bored*. When the\nGame demands extreme skills the challenge is too much for us and we\nexperience *anxiety*. When the Challenge presented is just barely\nmatched by our Skill, we are in the zone of *Flow*, or what I call\n*Play*.\n\nA good metaphoric image for this experience is as follows:--- that we\nlive in a space where the *Floor of Boredom* is always rising and would\ncrush us against our *Ceiling of Anxiety*. One Way to deal with this is\nto develop more Skills and *push the Ceiling away*, effectively moving\ninto the zone of Flow. Another Way of looking at this is what Carse\nsuggests: *When Play is no longer possible, change the Game.*\n\nSo what does all this have to do with getting veggies?\n\nThe ad is, in my opinion, all about Boredom, and how to avoid it. And\nnot offend anybody. The Young Man (hereinafter, \"YM\") simply has to\naccompany his Mom, and be there while she gets the veggies. I will\nexaggerate his irritation and his boredom at the risk of offending young\npeople likely to read this, and say that *he would rather not be there*\nbut he does not want to hurt Mom.\n\nWe are now ready for the TRIZ based Analysis of this Problem!\n\n## A TRIZ Analysis of a Visit to the Subzi Mandi\n\nFor a TRIZ workflow, we proceed as\n[**before**](https://arvindvenkatadri.com/project/2022-12-20-triz-lawrence-of-arabia/):\n\nFirst, using the method described in [*Open Source\nTRIZ*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cah0OhCH55k), we identify *knobs*\nor *parameters* within the situation and see how turning these could\nlead to identifying a Cause for a Problem in the form of a\n*Contradiction*.\n\nHere below is a quick *Ishikawa Diagram* to help us identify the\nParameters of this Problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTurning the *knobs/parameters* in the Ishikawa Diagram, it seems that if\nthe YM goes to the market with Mom, he would most likely get bored, but\nwould please Mom. If he doesn't go, then he chills at home, but Mom is\ngoing to justifiably furious. Herein lies the *Contradiction*, which we\ncan now specify as an [**Administrative\nContradiction(AC)**](https://altshuller.ru/world/eng/triz6.asp) in\n*plain English*:\n\n> <center>**AC**: The YM wants to chill at home but Mom wants him to\n> take her veggie shopping. He has to put up with the *`Waste of Time`*,\n> and being bored, and *`Stress`* at being away from friends.</center>\n\nNext, based on this Contradiction and the inspection of the Ishikawa\nDiagram above, we are now ready to define a TRIZ *Ideal Final Result*:\n\n> <center>**IFR**: The YM must go to the Market and not be\n> bored.</center>\n\nNote again the impossible sounding way of expressing the IFR! One needs\npractice, like the Queen in Alice in Wonderland, who could think of *Six\nImpossible Things before Breakfast* ! Also note there could be other\nways of specifying the IFR. See below, section [Alternative Ideas for\nIFR].\n\nLet us take the AC and convert it into a *Technical Contradiction(TC)*,\nkeeping this IFR in mind. We will look at the *48 TRIZ Parameters* in\nthe [*TRIZ Contradiction Matrix*\n**(PDF)**](/pdf/TRIZ/ContradictionMatrix2003.pdf) and see which\nParameter we want to improve, while not worsening another. Here is what\nwe can obtain. We will analyze each Contradiction both ways[^1]:\n\n> **- TC 1**: Improve `Loss of Time` (26) and not worsen\n> `Effect of External Harmful Factors` (30)\n>\n> **- TC 2**: Improve `Increase Productivity` (44) and not worsen\n> `Stress` (19)\n\nHere we choose these Parameters based on our IFR that while going to the\nMarket may be unavoidable, Boredom need not ensue. Parameters chosen\nfrom the TRIZ Matrix can be thought of as *metaphors* for the knobs that\nlie within our AC. Going from the AC to the TC is an act of *making\nmetaphors*. We could easily have chosen the Parameter `Noise(29)` as the\n\"metaphoric thing\" to avoid, but the current IFR doesn't quite support\nthat. There is here a considerable flexibility and possibility for\nimaginative interpretations of the AC, but using the *language of TRIZ*.\n\nWe could also formulate a *Physical Contradiction(PC)*[^2]:\n\n> <center>**PC**: The YM must be in the market and not be in the market\n> at the same time.</center>\n\nwhich is aimed squarely at one of the *Assumptions* in the Problem, that\nthe YM simply has to go. Again, if the IFR is formulated differently we\ncould obtain a very different set of AC and PC. See below, section\n[Alternative Ideas for IFR].\n\nIn a future post, we will deal with using the *PC* and the *TRIZ\nSeparation Principles* to solve Problems.\n\n## Solving the Technical Contradiction\n\nLet us take the both the TC-s into the Contradiction Matrix and arrive\nat the list of TRIZ Inventive Principles. Here is the Matrix solution\nfor TC-1 in the figure below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matrix.png){width=306}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nThe two squares for the TC1 have been circled in red, solving TC-1.\n\nThe Inventive Principles are:(TC1, TC2, both ways)\n\n1.  1(Segmentation)\n\n2.  35(Parameter Change)\n\n3.  21(Skipping)\n\n4.  18(Mechanical Vibration) (**!!**)\n\n5.  2(Taking Out/Separation)\n\n6.  10(Prior Action)\n\n7.  36(Phase Transitions)\n\n    and with TC2:\n\n8.  3(Local Quality)\n\n9.  14(Spheroidality/Curvature)\n\n10. 9(Preliminary Anti-Action)\n\n11. 37(Thermal Expansion)\n\n12. 40(Composite Materials)\n\n13. 25(Self Service)\n\n14. 24(Intermediary)\n\nThat is a considerable list for us to try to use!! Let us apply some\nthese Inventive Principles! Viewing these Inventive Principles as we\n*Generalized Solutions* we try to map these back into the Problem at\nhand:\n\n-   **35(Parameter Change)**: Which Parameter to change? Location? No.\n    Sound? Change the \"Bargaining Talk\" into what? Sweet Musical\n    Lyrics!!ðŸŽµðŸ¤£\n-   **18(Mechanical Vibration)** : What, make noise of your own? Yes!\n    Play Music !!ðŸ”‰ ðŸ¤£\n-   **14(Spheroidality)**: Wear \"spherical\" headphones!!ðŸŽ§! Create a\n    \"sound sphere\"! This is a long shot!!\n-   **3(Local Quality)**: also indicates the creation of a \"local\"\n    cocoon around the YM, but needs to be combined with *18(Mechanical\n    Vibration)* to truly arrive at the musical solution!\n\nOne could make decent interpretations of **2(Taking Out/Separation)**,\nand **24(Intermediary)**, but we are already there! The rest are perhaps\n(at least to me!) not very evocative, unless **37(Thermal Expansion)**\nmeans \"throw a temper tantrum at Mom\"? Never! So there you have it! The\n[**Cinderella song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwdQx2P_ytk)\nplayed on Spotify becomes not just a *noise canceller* but actually\nseems to substitute the very conversation between Mom and the vendor.\nAnd the YM has successfully attained Flow ! And the IFR too, since with\nthe music in his head, he is effectively \"in the marketplace *and* not\nin the marketplace *at the same time*!\n\nAnd I attained Flow in writing this!!\n\n## Alternative Ideas for IFR\n\nWe note in passing that there is more than one way of formulating the\n*Ideal Final Result*. Here are two more examples:\n\n> <center>\n>\n> **IFR2**: The veggies should arrive without (the YM) going to the\n> Market\n>\n> **IFR3**: Food should be prepared without having to go buy veggies.\n>\n> </center>\n\nClearly these are at least as good as the one we have chosen, sounding\nnicely \"impossible\" in their own right! The point is that in the\nanalysis of the Problem, we do need to ask *Who has the Problem,* as we\ndid*,* and the IFR needs to stem from there. These alternative IFRs\ncould well be the [**Voice of (another)\nCustomer**](https://www.mit.edu/~hauser/Papers/Gaskin_Griffin_Hauser_et_al%20VOC%20Encyclopedia%202011.pdf).\n\nIf there is any interesting situation that could be analyzed with TRIZ,\nplease send me a DM!
