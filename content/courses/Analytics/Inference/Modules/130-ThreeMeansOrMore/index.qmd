## {{< iconify openmoji japanese-symbol-for-beginner >}} Introduction

Suppose we have three sales strategies on our website, to sell a certain product, say men's shirts. We have observations of customer website interactions over several months. How do we know which strategy makes people buy the fastest ?

If there is a University course that is offered in parallel in three different classrooms, is there a difference between the average marks obtained by students in each of the classrooms?

In each case we have a set of Quant observations in each Qual category: `Interaction Time` vs `Sales Strategy` in the first example, and `Student Marks` vs `Classroom` in the second. We can take *mean* scores in each category and decide to compare them. How do we make the comparisons? One way would be to compare them pair-wise, doing as many `t-tests` as there are pairs. But with this rapidly becomes intractable and also dangerous: with increasing number of `groups`, the number of mean-comparisons becomes very large $N\choose 2$ and with each comparison the possibility of some difference showing up, *just by chance*, increases! And we end up making the wrong inference and perhaps the wrong decision. The trick is of course to make comparisons **all at once** and ANOVA is the technique that allows us to do just that. 

In this tutorial, we will compare the Hatching Time of frog spawn[^1], at three different lab temperatures.

In this tutorial, our research question is:

::: callout-note
## Research Question

Based on the sample dataset at hand, how does frogspawn hatching time vary with different temperature settings?
:::

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Read the Data

Download the data by clicking the button below.

{{< downloadthis data/frogs.csv dname="frogs" label="Download the frogs data" icon="database-fill-down" type="info" >}}

::: callout-important
### Data Folder

Save the CSV in a subfolder titled "data" inside your R work folder.
:::

```{r}
#| label: chunk-1
frogs_orig <- read_csv("data/frogs.csv")
frogs_orig

```

Our response variable is the hatching `Time`. Our explanatory variable is a *factor*, `Temperature`, with 3 levels: 13°C, 18°C and 25°C. Different samples of spawn were subject to each of these temperatures respectively.

## {{< iconify material-symbols pivot-table-chart >}} Workflow: Clean the Data

The data is in wide-format, with a separate column for each Temperature, and a common column for Sample ID. This is good for humans, but poor for a computer: there are NA entries since not all samples of spawn can be subject to all temperatures. (E.g. Sample ID #1 was maintained at 13°C, and there are NAs in the other two columns, which we don't need).

We will first stack up the `Temperature` columns into a single column, separate that into pieces and then retain just the number part (13, 18, 25), getting rid of the *word* `Temperature` from the column titles. Then the remaining **numerical** column with temperatures (13, 18, 25) will be converted into a factor.

We will use `pivot_longer()`and `separate_wider_regex()` to achieve this. \[See this animation for pivot_longer(): <https://haswal.github.io/pivot/> \]

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
frogs_orig %>%
  pivot_longer(
    .,
    cols = starts_with("Temperature"),
    cols_vary = "fastest",
    # new in pivot_longer
    names_to = "Temp",
    values_to = "Time"
  ) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ##
  separate_wider_regex(
    cols = Temp,
  # knock off the unnecessary "Temperature" word
  # Just keep the digits thereafter
    patterns = c("Temperature", TempFac = "\\d+"),
    cols_remove = TRUE) %>%
  
  # Convert Temp into TempFac, a 3-level factor
  mutate(TempFac = factor(
    x = TempFac,
    levels = c(13, 18, 25),
    labels = c("13", "18", "25")
  )) %>%
  rename("Id" = `Frogspawn sample id`) -> frogs_long
frogs_long
##
frogs_long %>% count(TempFac)


```

So we have cleaned up our data and have `20` samples for Hatching `Time` per `TempFac` setting.

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: EDA

Let us plot some histograms and boxplots of Hatching Time:

```{r}
#| fig-column: margin
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##
gf_histogram(~ Time, fill = ~ TempFac,
  data = frogs_long, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ mean(Time)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Histograms of Hatching Time Distributions vs Temperature",
          x = "Hatching Time", y = "Count") %>%
  gf_text(7 ~ (mean(Time) + 2),
          label = "Overall Mean") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_paletteer_d("ggthemes::colorblind"), 
            guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Temperature level (°C)")))

```




```{r}
#| fig-column: margin
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
##
gf_boxplot(data = frogs_long,
           Time ~ TempFac,
           fill = ~ TempFac,
           alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = ~ mean(Time)) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Boxplots of Hatching Time Distributions vs Temperature",
          x = "Temperature", y = "Hatching Time", 
          caption = "Using ggprism") %>%
  gf_refine(scale_fill_paletteer_d("ggthemes::colorblind"),
            scale_x_discrete(guide = "prism_bracket"),
            guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Temperature level (°C)"))) 

```

The histograms look well separated and the box plots also show very little overlap. So we can reasonably hypothesize that Temperature has a significant effect on Hatching Time.

Let's go ahead with our ANOVA test.

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: ANOVA

We will first execute the ANOVA test with code and evaluate the results. Then we will do an *intuitive walkthrough* of the process and finally, *hand-calculate* entire analysis for clear understanding. For now, a little faith!

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}

### Code

R offers a very simple command `aov` to execute an ANOVA test: Note the familiar `formula` of stating the variables:

```{r}
#| label: ANOVA-with-code
frogs_anova <- aov(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)
```

This creates an *ANOVA model object*, called `frogs_anova`. We can examine the ANOVA model object best with a package called `supernova`[^7]:

```{r}
# library(supernova)
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
supernova::pairwise(frogs_anova,
                    correction = "Bonferroni", #Try "Tukey"
                    alpha = 0.05, #95% CI calculation
                    var_equal = TRUE, #We'll see
                    plot = TRUE)
```

This table + error-bar plot gives us a clear comparison between each pair of the three groups of observations defined by `TempFac`. The differences in spawn hatching `Time` between each pair of `TempFac` settings are given by the `diff` column. Also shown are the confidence intervals for each of these differences (none of which include $0$); the `p-value`s for each of these differences is also negligible. Thus we can conclude that the **effect of temperature on hatching time** is significant. 

::: callout-note
To find which specific value of `TempFac` has the most `effect` will require *pairwise comparison* of the group means, using a standard `t-test`. The confidence level for such repeated comparisons will need what is called ***Bonferroni correction***[^2] to prevent us from detecting a significant (pair-wise) difference simply by chance. To do this we take $\alpha = 0.05$, the confidence level used and divide it by $K$, the number of pair-wise comparisons we intend to make. This new value is used to decide on the significance of the estimated parameter. So the pairwise comparisons in our current data will have to use $\alpha/3 = 0.0166$ as the confidence level. The `supernova::pairwise()` function did this for us very neatly!

There are also other ways, such as the "Tukey correction" for multiple tests. 
:::


### Intuitive {#sec-anova-intuitive}

All that is very well, but what is happening under the hood of the `aov()` command?

Consider a data set with a single Quant and a single Qual variable. The Qual variable has two levels, the Quant data has 20 observations per Qual level.

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| label: Anova-Intuitive
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#

library(ggtext)
set.seed(42) # for replication
toydata = tibble(
  index = 1:40,
  qual = c(rep(x = "A", 20), rep(x = "B", 20)),
  quant = c(rnorm(
    n = 20, mean = 0, sd = 2
  ),
  rnorm(
    n = 20, mean = 10, sd = 2
  ))
)
toydata

overall_mean <- toydata %>%
  summarise(overall_mean = mean(quant))
#overall_mean

grouped_means <- toydata %>%
  group_by(qual) %>%
  summarise(grouped_means = mean(quant))
#grouped_means

p1 <- gf_segment(
  data = toydata,
  color = "black",
  overall_mean$overall_mean + quant ~ index + index,
  ylab = "quant") %>% 
  gf_point(quant ~ index,
               #color = ~ qual,
               data = toydata) %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept =  ~ overall_mean,
           data = overall_mean) %>%
  gf_text(4.25 ~ 30,
          label = expression(paste(mu, "_tot")),
          inherit = F) %>% 
gf_labs(title = "Fig A: SST")
##
p2 <- gf_point(
  quant ~ index,
  group = ~ qual,
  colour = ~ qual,
  data = toydata
) %>%
  gf_hline(
    yintercept = ~ mean,
    colour = ~ qual,
    data = toydata %>%
      group_by(qual) %>%
      summarise(mean = mean(quant))
  ) %>%
  gf_segment(data = toydata %>% filter(qual == "A"),
             grouped_means$grouped_means[1] + quant ~ index + index) %>%
  gf_segment(data = toydata %>% filter(qual == "B"),
             grouped_means$grouped_means[2] + quant ~ index + index) %>%
  gf_text(10.0 ~ 10,
          label = expression(paste(mu, "_B")),
          inherit = F) %>%
  gf_text(1 ~ 38,
          label = expression(paste(mu, "_A")),
          inherit = F) %>% 
  gf_refine(scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")) %>%
gf_labs(title = "Fig B: SSE")

#cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c("Fig A: SST", "Fig B: SSE"))
patchwork::wrap_plots(p1,p2)

```

**All Data**: In Fig A, the *horizontal* black line is the overall mean of `quant`, denoted as $\mu_{tot}$. The vertical black lines to the points show the departures of each point from this overall mean. The sum of *squares* of these vertical black lines in Fig A is called the [**Total Sum of Squares** (SST)]{style="background-color: yellow;"}.

$$
SST = \Sigma (y - \mu_{tot})^2
$$ {#eq-SST}

**Grouped Data**: In Fig B, the *horizontal* green and red lines are the means of the individual groups, respectively $\mu_A$ and $\mu_B$. The green and red vertical lines are the departures, or errors, of each point from *its own group-mean*. The sum of the *squares* of the green and red lines is called the [**Total Error Sum of Squares** (SSE)]{style="background-color: yellow;"}.

$$
SSE = \Sigma [(y - \mu_A)^2] + \Sigma (y - \mu_B)^2]
$$ {#eq-SSE}

**Improvement**: We take the difference in the squared error sums:

$$
SSA = SST - SSE
$$ {#eq-SSA}

[$SSA$ is called the **Treatment Sum of Squares**]{style="background-color: yellow;"}, the "improvement" in going from believing in one mean to believing in two.

**Improvement Ratio**: $SSA/SSE$ might now help us decide whether *two means are better than one*. 

Let us compute these numbers for our toy dataset:

```{r}
#| echo: true
demo_anova <- aov(quant ~ qual, data = toydata)
supernova::supernova(demo_anova)
```
What do we see?

1. **All Data**: $SST = 1047.935$. 
1. **Grouped Data**: $SSE = 224.529$.
1. **Improvement**: $SSA = SST-SSE$ = $823.407$.
1. **Improvement Ratio**: Before we set up this ratio, we must realize that each of these measures uses a different number of observations! So the comparison is done after scaling each of $SSA$ and $SSE$ by the [number of observations]{.bg-washed-red .black} influencing them. (a sort of ***per capita***, or average, squared error, an idea we saw when we defined [Standard Errors](../../Modules/20-SampProb/index.qmd#the-standard-error)): $F_{stat} = \frac{SSA / df_{SSA}}{SSE / df_{SSE}}$, where $df_{SSA} = 1$ and $df_{SSE} = 38$ are respectively the degrees of freedom in $SSA$ and $SSE$. 
1. **Large Enough Ratio?**: The value of the `F-statistic` from the table above is $\frac{823.407}{5.909} = 139.356$. Is this ratio big enough? `F-statistic` is compared with a **critical value** of the `F-critical` to help us decide. (Here, it is.)
1. **Belief**: So we now believe in the idea of two means. 
1. **Back to Mean Differences**: Finally, in order to find which of the means is significantly different from others (if there are more than two!), we need to make a pair-wise comparison of the means, applying the `Bonferroni correction` as stated before. This means we divide the critical `p.value` we expect by the number of comparisons we make between levels of the Qual variable. `supernova` did this for us in the error-bar plot above. 


::: callout-important
## Why "ANOVA"?
When divide each of $SSA$ and $SSE$ by their [*degrees of freedom*]{style="background-color: yellow;"}, this gives us [a ratio of **variances**, the F-statistic]{style="background-color: yellow;"}. [And so we are in effect deciding if means are significantly different by analyzing (a ratio of) variances!]{style="background-color: yellow;"} Hence the name, *AN-alysis O-f VA-riance*, **ANOVA**.

So this may seem like a great [Hero's Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnaXpcH7L6I&list=PLsvuw0vMeKQ0CWR-YpAYH90YjYPck6Ots&pp=iAQB), where we start with means and differences, go into sums of squares, differences and comparisons of error ratios, and [return to the means where we started, only to know them properly now](https://www.quora.com/profile/Arvind-Venkatadri/https-www-quora-com-What-did-T-S-Elliot-mean-when-he-wrote-We-must-not-cease-from-exploration-and-the-end-of-all-our-e).


### Frogs Demonstrated

Now that we understand what `aov()` is doing, let us hand-calculate the numbers for our `frogs` dataset and check. Let us visualize our calculations first.

frogs_plot <- frogs_long %>% 
  arrange(TempFac) %>% 
           rowid_to_column(var = "index")

    gf_refine(scale_colour_paletteer_d("ggthemes::colorblind"),
              
            guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Temperature level (°C)"))) %>% 
  
 gf_hline(yintercept =  ~ overall_mean,
             data = frogs_mean) %>% 
  
  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot, 
             color = "black",
             frogs_mean$overall_mean + Time ~ index + index)

##

             summarise(overall_mean = mean(Time))
##
frogs_grouped_means <- frogs_long %>%
  group_by(TempFac) %>% 
             summarise(grouped_means = mean(Time))
##
gf_point(Time ~ index, 
         group = ~ TempFac, 
         colour = ~ TempFac, 
         data = frogs_plot, title = "Calculating SSE Error Sum of Squares") %>% 
  
    gf_refine(scale_colour_paletteer_d("ggthemes::colorblind"),
              
            guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Temperature level (°C)"))) %>% 
  
  gf_hline(yintercept = ~ grouped_means, 
           colour = ~ TempFac,
           data = frogs_grouped_means) %>% 
  
  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 13 ),
             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[1] + Time ~ index + index
             ) %>% 
  
  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 18),
             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[2] + Time ~ index + index
             ) %>% 
  
  gf_segment(data = frogs_plot %>% filter(TempFac == 25),
             frogs_grouped_means$grouped_means[3] + Time ~ index + index
             )

```

Let us get the ready table from `supernova` first, and then systematically calculate all numbers with understanding:

```{r}
supernova::supernova(frogs_anova)
```
Here are the SST, SSE, and the SSA:

```{r}
#| label: SST-Total-Sum-of-Squares

# Calculate overall sum squares SST
frogs_overall <- frogs_long %>% 
  summarise(overall_mean_time = mean(Time), 
            # Overall mean across all readings
            # The Black Line
            
            SST = sum((Time - overall_mean_time)^2),
            n = n()) # Always do this with `summarise`

frogs_overall
##
SST <- frogs_overall$SST
SST
```



```{r}
#| label: SSE-Within-Group-Sum-of-Squares
#| results: hold

# Calculate sums of square errors *within* each group
# with respect to individual group means
frogs_within_groups <- frogs_long %>% 
  group_by(TempFac) %>% 
   summarise(
     grouped_mean_time = mean(Time), # The Coloured Lines
     grouped_variance_time = var(Time),
     group_error_squares = sum((Time - grouped_mean_time)^2),
     n = n())
frogs_within_groups
##
frogs_SSE <- frogs_within_groups %>% 
  summarise(SSE = sum(group_error_squares))
##
SSE <- frogs_SSE$SSE
SSE

```



```{r}
#| results: hold

SST
SSE
SSA <- SST - SSE
SSA

```



We have $SST = 1096$, $SSE = 75.4$ and therefore $SSA = 1020.9$.

In order to calculate the F-Statistic, we need to compute the variances, using these sum of squares. We obtain variances by dividing by their *Degrees of Freedom*:

$$
F_{stat} = \frac{SSA / df_{SSA}}{SSE / df_{SSE}}
$$

where $df_{SSA}$ and $df_{SSE}$ are respectively the degrees of freedom in SSA and SSE.

Let us calculate these [Degrees of Freedom]{style="background-color: yellow;"}.

With $k = 3$ levels in the factor `TempFac`, and $n = 20$ points per level, $SST$ clearly has degree of freedom $kn-1 = 3*20~ -1 = 59$, since it uses all observations but loses one degree to calculate the global mean. (If each level did not have the same number of points $n$, we simply take all observations less one as the degrees of freedom for $SST$).

$SSE$ has $k*(n-1) = 3 * (20 -1) = 57$ as degrees of freedom, since each of the $k$ groups there are $n$ observations and each group loses one degree to calculate its own group mean.

And therefore $SSA$, being their difference, has $kn-1 -k*(n-1) = k-1 = 2$ degrees of freedom. 

These are, of course, as shown in the *df* column in the supernova tabel above. We can still calculate these in R, for the sake of method and clarity (and pedantry):

```{r}
#| label: Degrees-of-Freedom

# Error Sum of Squares SSE
df_SSE <- frogs_long %>%
  
  # Takes into account "unbalanced" situations
  # Where groups are not equal in size
  group_by(TempFac) %>%
  summarise(per_group_df_SSE = n() - 1) %>%
  summarise(df_SSE = sum(per_group_df_SSE)) %>% as.numeric()


## Overall Sum of Squares SST
df_SST <- frogs_long %>%
  summarise(df_SST = n() - 1) %>% as.integer()


# Treatment Sum of Squares SSA
k <- length(unique(frogs_long$TempFac))
df_SSA <- k - 1

```

The degrees of freedom for the quantities are:

```{r}
#| results: hold
#| layout-ncol: 2
df_SST
df_SSE
df_SSA

```

Now we are ready to compute the F-statistic: dividing each sum-of-squares byt its degrees of freedom gives us *variances* which we will compare, using the *F-statistic* as a ratio:

```{r}
# Finally F_Stat!
# Combine the sum-square_error for each level of the factor
# Weighted by degrees of freedom **per level**
# Which are of course equal here ;-D

MSE <- frogs_within_groups %>% 
  summarise(mean_square_error = sum(group_error_squares/df_SSE)) %>% 
  as.numeric()
MSE
##
MSA <- SSA/df_SSA # This is OK
MSA
##
F_stat <- MSA/MSE
F_stat

```

The `F-stat` is compared with a **critical value** of the F-statistic, `F_crit` which is computed using the formula for the f-distribution in R. As with our hypothesis tests, we set the significance level to $\alpha = 0.95$, but here with the Bonferroni correction, and quote the two relevant degrees of freedom as parameters to `qf()` which computes the critical F value `F_critical` as a **quartile**:

```{r}
#| results: hold
F_crit <-  
  qf(p = (1 - 0.05/3),  # Significance level is 5% + Bonferroni Correction
      df1 = df_SSA, # Numerator degrees of freedom 
      df2 = df_SSE  # Denominator degrees of freedom
     ) 
F_crit
F_stat

```

The `F_crit` value can also be seen in a plot[^4],[^5]:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
gf_dist("f", df1 = df_SSA, df2 = df_SSE,
        fill = ~ (x <= F_crit), geom = "area") %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = F_crit, 
           colour = "red",title = "F distribution for Frog ANOVA") %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = F_stat,
           color = "dodgerblue") %>%
  gf_text( 0.25 ~ 360, label = "F_stat", colour = "dodgerblue") %>%
  gf_text( 0.25 ~ 20, label = "F_crit", colour = "red") 

```


```{r}
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
mosaic::xpf(q = F_crit, 
            df1 = df_SSA, df2 = df_SSE, method = "gg",
            log.p = FALSE,lower.tail = TRUE, 
            return = "plot") %>% 
  gf_vline(xintercept = F_crit) %>% 
  gf_label(0.75 ~ 5.5, label = "F_critical", 
           inherit = F, show.legend = F) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "F distribution for Frogs Data",
          subtitle = "F_critical = 4.403")

```


Any value of F more than the `F_crit` occurs with smaller probability than $0.05/3 = 0.017$. Our F_stat is much higher than `F_crit`, by orders of magnitude! And so we can say with confidence that Temperature has a significant effect on spawn Time.

And that is how ANOVA computes!

## {{< iconify carbon model >}} Stating the Model


And `supernova` gives us a nice linear equation relating `Hatching_Time` to `TempFac`:

```{r}
#| label: fig-eq-frogs-anova
supernova::equation(frogs_anova)

```
`TempFac18` and `TempFac25` are binary {0,1} coded variables, representing the test situation. `e` is the remaining error. The equation models the *means* at each value of `TempFac`. 

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Checking ANOVA Assumptions

ANOVA makes 3 fundamental assumptions:

a.  Data (and errors) are normally distributed.
b.  Variances are equal.
c.  Observations are independent.

We can check these using checks and graphs.

### {{< iconify ic twotone-rule >}} Checks for Normality

The `shapiro.wilk` test tests if a vector of numeric data is normally distributed and rejects the hypothesis of normality when the [p-value](https://variation.com/wp-content/distribution_analyzer_help/hs132.htm) is less than or equal to 0.05. 

```{r}
#| label: Check for Normality
shapiro.test(x = frogs_long$Time)

```

The p-value is very low and we cannot reject the (alternative) hypothesis that the overall data is **not** normal. How about normality at each level of the factor?

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
frogs_grouped <- frogs_long %>% 
  group_by(TempFac) %>% 
  nest(.key = "list") # naming the nested column "list"
frogs_grouped

# Checking if we can purrr
frogs_grouped %>% 
  purrr::pluck("list", 1) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Time) %>% 
  as_vector() %>% 
  shapiro.test(.)

# OK now we are set for group-wise Shapiro-Wilk testing with purrr:

frogs_grouped %>% 
  mutate(shaptest = 
           purrr::map(.x = list, # Column name is "list"
                      .f = \(.x) select(.data = .x, 
                                        Time) %>% 
                                 as_vector() %>% 
                                 shapiro.test(.)),
         
         params = 
           purrr::map(.x = shaptest,
                      .f = \(.x) broom::tidy(.x))) %>% 
  
  select(TempFac, params) %>% 
  unnest(cols = params)

```

::::

The `shapiro.wilk` test makes a NULL Hypothesis that the data **are** normally distributed and estimates the probability that the given data could have happened by chance. Except for `TempFac = 18` the `p.value`s are less than 0.05 and we can reject the NULL hypothesis that each of these is normally distributed. Perhaps this is a sign that we need more than 20 samples per factor level. Let there be more frogs !!! இன்னும தவளைகள் வேண்டும்!!
!!

We can also check the residuals post-model:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| column: screen-inset-right
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
frogs_anova$residuals %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  gf_dhistogram(~ value,data = .) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Residuals Histogram",
          x = "Residuals", y = "Count") %>%
  gf_fitdistr() 
##
frogs_anova$residuals %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  gf_qq(~ value, data = .) %>% 
  gf_qqstep() %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Residuals Q-Q Plot",
          x = "Theoretical Quantiles", y = "Sample Quantiles") %>%
  gf_qqline() 
##
shapiro.test(frogs_anova$residuals)

```

Unsurprisingly, the residuals are also not normally distributed either.

### {{< iconify ic twotone-rule >}} Check for Similar Variance

Response data with different variances at different levels of an *explanatory* variable are said to exhibit **heteroscedasticity**. This violates one of the assumptions of ANOVA.

To check if the `Time` readings are similar in `variance` across levels of `TempFac`, we can use the [Levene Test]{style="background-color: yellow;"}, or since our per-group observations are not normally distributed, a non-parametric rank-based [Fligner-Killeen Test]{style="background-color: yellow;"}. The NULL hypothesis is that the data **are** with similar variances. The tests assess how probable this is with the given data assuming this NULL hypothesis:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: screen-inset-right
#| results: hold
frogs_long %>% 
  group_by(TempFac) %>% 
  summarise(variance = var(Time))
# Not too different...OK on with the test
DescTools::LeveneTest(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)
##
fligner.test(Time ~ TempFac, data = frogs_long)
```

It seems that there is no cause for concern here; the data do not have significantly different variances.

### {{< iconify ic twotone-rule >}} Independent Observations

This is an experiment *design* concern; the way the data is gathered must be specified such that data for each level of the factors ( factor combinations if there are more than one) should be independent.

## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: Effect Size

The simplest way to find the actual `effect sizes` detected by an ANOVA test is something we have already done, with the `supernova` package: Here is the table and plot again:

```{r}
#| fig-column: margin
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
frogs_supernova <- 
  supernova::pairwise(frogs_anova,
                      plot = TRUE,
                      alpha = 0.05, 
                      correction = "Bonferroni")
frogs_supernova

```

This table, the plot, and the equation we set up earlier all give us the sense of how the `TempFac` affects `Time`. The differences are given pair-wise between levels of the Qual factor, `TempFac`, and the `standard error` has been declared in *pooled* fashion (all groups together).

::: {.hidden}
We can also use (paradoxically) the `summary.lm()` command:

```{r}
tidy_anova <- 
  frogs_anova %>% 
  summary.lm() %>% 
  broom::tidy()
tidy_anova

```

It may take a bit of effort to understand this. First the `TempFac` is arranged in order of levels, and the `mean` at the $TempFac = 13$ is titled `Intercept`. That is $26.3$. The other two means for levels $18$ and $25$ are stated as **differences** from this intercept, $-5.3$ and $-10.1$ respectively. The `p.value` for all these effect sizes is well below the desired confidence level of $0.05$.

::: callout-note
### Standard Errors

Observe that the `std.error` for the intercept is $0.257$ while that for `TempFac18` and `TempFac25` is $0.257 \times \sqrt2 = 0.363$ since the latter are **differences** in means, while the former is a **single mean**. The Variance of a difference is the sum of the individual variances, which are equal here.
:::

We can easily plot bar-chart with error bars for the effect size:

```{r}
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
tidy_anova %>% 
  mutate(hi = estimate + std.error,
         lo = estimate - std.error) %>% 
  gf_hline(data = ., yintercept = 0, 
           colour ="grey", 
           linewidth = 2) %>% 
  gf_col(estimate ~ term, 
         fill = "grey", 
         color = "black",
         width = 0.15) %>% 
  gf_errorbar(hi + lo ~ term,
              color = "blue",
              width = 0.2) %>% 
  gf_point(estimate ~ term,
           color = "red", 
           size = 3.5) %>% 
  gf_refine(scale_x_discrete("Temperature (°C)", 
                             labels = c("13°C", "18°C", "25°C"))) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Effect Size of Temperature on Spawn Time",
          subtitle = "ANOVA: Frogs Spawn Time vs Temperature Setting",
          caption = "Relative Effect Values",
          x = "Temperature (°C)", y = "Effect Size (Spawn Time)")

  
```

If we want an "absolute value" plot for effect size, it needs just a little bit of work:

```{r}
# Merging group averages with `std.error`
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#

frogs_long %>% 
  group_by(TempFac) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(Time)) %>% 
  cbind(std.error = tidy_anova$std.error) %>% 
  mutate(hi = mean + std.error,
         lo = mean - std.error) %>% 
  gf_hline(data = ., yintercept = 0, 
           colour ="grey", 
           linewidth = 2) %>% 
  gf_col(mean ~ TempFac, 
         fill = "grey", 
         color = "black", width = 0.15) %>% 
  gf_errorbar(hi + lo ~ TempFac,
                color = "blue",
                width =0.2) %>% 
  gf_point(mean ~ TempFac, 
           color = "red", 
           size = 3.5) %>% 
  gf_refine(scale_x_discrete("Temperature (°C)", 
                             labels = c("13°C", "18°C", "25°C"))) %>% 
  gf_labs(title = "Effect Size of Temperature on Spawn Time",
          subtitle = "ANOVA: Frogs Spawn Time vs Temperature Setting",
          caption = "Absolute Effect Values",
          x = "Temperature (°C)", y = "Effect Size (Spawn Time)")

```

In both graphs, note the difference in the error-bar heights.

The ANOVA test does not tell us that the "treatments" (i.e. levels of `TempFac`) are equally effective. We need to use a *multiple comparison* procedure to arrive at an answer to that question. We compute the pair-wise differences in effect-size:

```{r}
frogs_anova %>% stats::TukeyHSD()

```
We see that **each** of the pairwise differences in effect-size is significant, with `p = 0` !
:::

### Using other packages{.hidden}

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills style="background: whitesmoke;"}
### Using ggstatsplot

There is a very neat package called `ggstatsplot`[^6] that allows us to plot very comprehensive statistical graphs. Let us quickly do this:

```{r}
#| message: false
# Set graph theme
theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
library(ggstatsplot)
frogs_long %>%
  ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(x = TempFac, y = Time, 
                             colour = TempFac, alpha = 0.8,
                             type = "parametric",
                             pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,
                             p.adjust.method = "bonferroni",
                             conf.level = 0.95,
# Plot parameters for the points
  point.args = list(position = ggplot2::position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.6), alpha =
    0.8, size = 3, stroke = 0, na.rm = TRUE),

# Plot parameters for the boxplots
  boxplot.args = list(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.2, na.rm = TRUE),

# Plot parameters for the violin plots
  violin.args = list(width = 0.5, alpha = 0.2, na.rm = TRUE),
                             title = "ANOVA : Frogs Spawn Time vs Temperature Setting") + 
  scale_colour_paletteer_d("ggthemes::colorblind") +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", y = "Spawn Time (seconds)")


```
Probably a case of too much in one plot, but it does give us a lot of information, including the pairwise comparisons and the effect sizes. The `ggstatsplot` package is very useful for quick visualizations of statistical tests.

### Using supernova

We can also obtain crisp-looking anova tables from the new `supernova` package [^7], which is based on the methods discussed in Judd et al. @sec-references

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 2
library(supernova)
supernova::supernova(frogs_anova)
supernova::pairwise(frogs_anova)

```

The `supernova` table clearly shows the reduction the Sum of Squares as we go from a NULL (empty) model to a full ANOVA model.
:::


## {{< iconify flat-color-icons workflow >}} Workflow: ANOVA using Permutation Tests

We wish to establish the significance of the effect size due to each of the levels in `TempFac`. From the normality tests conducted earlier we see that except at one level of `TempFac`, the times are are not normally distributed. Hence we opt for a Permutation Test to check for significance of effect.

As remarked in Ernst[^8], the non-parametric permutation test can be both *exact* and also **intuitively easier** for students to grasp.

We proceed with a Permutation Test for `TempFac`. We shuffle the levels (13, 18, 25) randomly between the Times and repeat the ANOVA test each time and calculate the F-statistic. The Null distribution is the distribution of the F-statistic over the many permutations and the p-value is given by the proportion of times the F-statistic equals or exceeds that observed.

We will use `infer` to do this: We calculate the observed F-stat with `infer`, which also has a very direct, if verbose, syntax for doing permutation tests:

```{r}
#| label: ANOVA F-statistic with infer

observed_infer <- 
  frogs_long %>% 
  specify(Time ~ TempFac) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "F")
observed_infer

```

We see that the observed F-Statistic is of course $385.8966$ as before. Now we use `infer` to generate a NULL distribution using permutation of the factor `TempFac`:

```{r}
#| label: Permutation using infer

null_dist_infer <- frogs_long %>% 
  specify(Time ~ TempFac) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 4999 , type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "F")
##
null_dist_infer
##
null_dist_infer %>% 
  visualise(method = "simulation") +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_infer$stat, direction = "right") + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10", expand = c(0,0)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.2,500), clip = "off") + 
  annotation_logticks(outside = FALSE) + 
  theme_custom()

```

As seen, the `infer` based permutation test also shows that the permutationally generated F-statistics are nowhere near that which was observed. The effect of `TempFac` is very strong.

## {{< iconify mingcute thought-line >}} Wait, But Why?

- In marketing, design, or business research, similar quantities may be measured across different locations, or stores, or categories of people, for instance.
- ANOVA is the tool to decide if the Quant variable has differences across the Qual categories.
- This approach can be extended to more than one Qual variable, and also if there is another Quant variable in the mix. 

## {{< iconify fluent-mdl2 decision-solid >}} Conclusions

We have discussed ANOVA as a means of modelling the effects of a Categorical variable on a Continuous (Quant) variable. ANOVA can be carried out using the standard formula `aov` when assumptions on distributions, variances, and independence are met. Permutation ANOVA tests can be carried out when these assumptions do not quite hold.

::: callout-note
### Two-Way ANOVA

What if we have *two* Categorical variables as predictors?

We then need to perform a **Two-Way ANOVA** analysis, where we look at the predictors individually (*main effects*) and together (*interaction effects*). Here too, we need to verify if the number of observations are balanced across all combinations of factors of the two Qualitative predictors. There are three different classical approaches (Type1, Type2, and Type3 ANOVA) for testing hypotheses in ANOVA for unbalanced designs, as they are called. [@langsrud2003].

:::

::: callout-note
### Informative Hypothesis Testing: Models which incorporate a priori Beliefs

Note that when we specified our research question, we had no specific hypothesis about the means, *other than that they might be different*. In many situations, we may have reason to believe in the relative "ordering" of the means for different levels of the Categorical variable. The one-sided t-test is the simplest example (e.g., $\mu_1 >= 0$ and $\mu_1 >= \mu_2$); this readily extends to the multi-parameter setting, where more than one inequality constraint can be imposed on the parameters (e.g., $\mu_1 <= \mu_2 <= \mu_3$.\
It *is* possible to incorporate these beliefs into the ANOVA model, using what is called as **informative hypothesis testing**, which have certain advantages compared to unconstrained models. The R package called `restriktor` has the capability to develop such models with beliefs.

$SSA$ can also directly be re-written in a very symmetric fashion as:

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{ij}\right)^2 }{n} - \frac{\left( \sum_{i=1}^{kn}
y_i \right)^2}{kn}
$$


Note that in the first term, we are calculating sums of observations within each group in the inner summation, which is like a per-group mean (without the division). The outer summation takes the sum of squares of these undivided summations and divides by $n$.

If there are $k$ levels in `qual` and $n$ observations $y_ n$ for each level, we can also write:

y_i \right)^2}{kn}
